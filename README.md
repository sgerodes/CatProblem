Find the cat


Question:

A cat is hiding in one of the five boxes. The boxes are numbered one to five and are all sitting in a row, lined up in order. Each night, the sneaky little cat hides in an adjacent box, exactly one box away from the box it’s in during the day. Each morning, you can open exactly one box to see if the cat is in there. Can you say with certainty that you will find the cat ? How can you go about this hide and seek game to ensure you find the cat?
